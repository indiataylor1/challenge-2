## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they are a good candidate for an open position
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click on one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with the titled images of the developer's applications 
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's images should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the application
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
